# NoResourceScannerPings

## Attribution

This repository is forked from [NoWetNoodleBasher by Th3Fanbus](https://github.com/Th3Fanbus/NoWetNoodleBasher). They did all of the work here, I just replaced a variable to target the resource scanner ping sound instead of the Xeno-Zapper sound. And added a cute pic of my dog.

## What is this

This removes the high pitch ping that happens when the resource scanner finds a resource because it freaked my dog out. Massive thank you to @Th3Fanbus for open-sourcing their mod and personally helping me in Discord when I couldn't figure out how to make changes to it.

## How to install

Just download these files and copy them into a "NoWetNoodleBasher" directory in Satisfactory's "Mods" directory
